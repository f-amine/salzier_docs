WhatsApp is more than just a tool for order updates; it's a powerful marketing channel with direct access to your most engaged customers. Because it's a personal space, marketing on WhatsApp requires a thoughtful approach.

<div class="steps">
### 1. New Product Launches
Give your loyal customers first dibs on new arrivals. A simple message with a high-quality product image and a direct link to the product page can drive significant early sales.

### 2. Flash Sale Announcements
Create urgency with time-sensitive offers. WhatsApp is perfect for flash sales because of its instant delivery. Announce a 24-hour sale and watch the orders roll in.

### 3. Back-in-Stock Alerts
Don't lose a sale just because an item was out of stock. Allow customers to opt-in for alerts, and use Whatsappier to automatically notify them the moment their desired product is available again.

### 4. Holiday & Seasonal Promotions
Whether it's Black Friday or a summer sale, WhatsApp is the perfect channel to cut through the noise. Send a targeted promotion with a special discount code.

### 5. Customer Feedback & Review Requests
A few days after an order is delivered, send a polite request for a product review. Make it easy by linking directly to the product page. Positive reviews are social proof that drives future sales.

### 6. Loyalty Program Updates
Inform your VIP customers about new loyalty perks, points balances, or exclusive offers. This makes them feel valued and encourages them to use their rewards.

### 7. Personalized Recommendations
Use purchase history data to send highly targeted recommendations. If a customer bought a pair of running shoes, you can later send them a message about new running socks or a hydration pack.

<Aside type="note" title="Permission is Key">
Always make sure you have explicit consent (opt-in) from your customers before sending them promotional messages. A simple checkbox at checkout is a great way to build your marketing list.
