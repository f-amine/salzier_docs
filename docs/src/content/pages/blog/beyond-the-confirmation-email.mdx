The moment a customer clicks "buy" is not the end of their journey; it's the beginning of their experience with your brand. While email confirmations are standard, they often get lost in cluttered inboxes. To build real trust and reduce anxiety, you need to meet your customers where they are: on WhatsApp.

Automated WhatsApp notifications for order status provide the instant, high-visibility communication that modern customers expect.

## Why WhatsApp is Superior for Order Updates

-   **Unbeatable Open Rates:** With a 98% open rate, your message is almost guaranteed to be seen.
-   **Reduce Support Tickets:** Proactively answering "Where is my order?" (WISMO) questions cuts down on repetitive support inquiries.
-   **Build Trust & Loyalty:** Timely updates show you care about the customer's experience, encouraging repeat business.

## Key Touchpoints to Automate

    #### 3. Delivery Confirmation
    Notify the customer as soon as their package is marked as delivered. This closes the loop and helps prevent "lost package" claims.

    #### 4. Feedback Request
    A few days after delivery, send a friendly message asking for a review. A direct link to your product page makes it easy for them to share their thoughts.

While WhatsApp is powerful, don't spam your customers. Stick to essential, value-added notifications related to their purchase.
