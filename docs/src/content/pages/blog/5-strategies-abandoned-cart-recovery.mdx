Did you know that nearly 70% of online shopping carts are abandoned? That's a huge amount of potential revenue left on the table. While emails are the traditional recovery method, their open rates are declining. WhatsApp, with its 98% open rate, is the new frontier for winning back those lost sales.

Here are five proven strategies to recover abandoned carts using Whatsappier.

<div class="steps">
### 1. Timing is Everything
Sending a reminder too soon can feel pushy, but waiting too long can lose the sale forever. The sweet spot is typically between 20 to 60 minutes after abandonment. This gives the customer time to have second thoughts but keeps the purchase fresh in their mind.

*In Whatsappier, you can set a custom delay in the "Abandoned Checkout Recovery" automation.*

### 2. Personalize the Message
A generic message is easy to ignore. A personal one grabs attention. Start your message by addressing the customer by their name. This simple touch makes the interaction feel more human and less like a robotic blast.

Hello `{{customer_name}}`, we noticed you left some items in your cart!


### 3. Include a Direct Recovery Link
This is the most critical part. Make it incredibly easy for the customer to return and complete their purchase. Your message must include a direct link that restores their exact shopping cart.

<Aside type="tip" title="Use the Magic Variable">
Whatsappier provides a `{{recovery_url}}` variable that automatically generates a unique link for each customer's abandoned cart. No manual work required!

### 4. Offer a Small Incentive
Sometimes, a little nudge is all it takes. A small, time-sensitive discount can be a powerful motivator.

**Example:**
`"Complete your purchase in the next 3 hours and get 10% off with code WELCOME10!"`

This creates a sense of urgency and adds value, making the customer feel special.

### 5. Keep it Conversational
Remember, this is WhatsApp, not email. Keep your message short, friendly, and to the point. Emojis can help convey a friendly tone.

✅ **Good:** `Hey {{customer_name}}! Still thinking it over? Your cart is waiting for you: {{recovery_url}}`

❌ **Bad:** `Dear Valued Customer, It has come to our attention that you have failed to complete the transaction process...`
