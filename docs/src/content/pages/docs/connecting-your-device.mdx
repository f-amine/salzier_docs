Connecting your WhatsApp device is the first and most important step to start automating your communication. This guide will walk you through the simple process of linking your WhatsApp account to the Whatsappier platform.

<div class="steps">
### Navigate to the Devices Page
From your Whatsappier dashboard, click on **"Devices"** in the main navigation sidebar. This will take you to the device management screen where you can see all your connected devices.

### Create a New Device
Click the **"Connect Whatsapp"** button. A dialog box will appear, prompting you to configure your new instance.

1.  **Instance Name:** Give your device a memorable name (e.g., "Main Business Number"). This is for your reference only.
2.  **Phone Number:** Enter your full WhatsApp phone number, including the country code (e.g., `15551234567`).
3.  Click **"Create Instance"**.

### Scan the QR Code
After creating the instance, a QR code will be displayed on your screen.

1.  Open **WhatsApp** on your phone.
2.  Go to **Settings** > **Linked Devices** > **Link a Device**.
3.  Scan the QR code displayed in the Whatsappier dialog.

If you prefer, some devices support a pairing code. This code will be displayed below the QR code. You can enter it on your phone instead of scanning.

Once the connection is successful, the dialog will close, and you will see your new device listed with a **"Connected"** status.

- **CONNECTED:** The device is online and ready to send messages.
- **DISCONNECTED:** The device is offline. You may need to reconnect it.
- **ERROR:** There was a problem with the connection. Try reconnecting or contacting support.
