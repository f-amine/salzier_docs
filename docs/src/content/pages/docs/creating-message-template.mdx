Templates are the heart of your automated messages. They allow you to craft personalized, reusable messages that can be triggered by your automations. Using dynamic variables, you can insert customer and order information directly into your messages for a personal touch.

<div class="steps">
### Navigate to Templates
From the dashboard, go to **"Templates"** in the sidebar.

### Create a New Template
Click the **"New Template"** button.

### Select Automation Type
Choose the type of automation this template will be used for (e.g., "Lightfunnels Order Confirmation"). This determines which variables will be available.

### Write Your Message
Give your template a clear name and craft your message in the content editor.
</div>

## Using Dynamic Variables

Variables are placeholders that will be automatically replaced with real data when the automation runs. They are wrapped in double curly braces, like `{{customer_name}}`.

<Aside type="tip" title="Use the 'Insert Variable' Dropdown">
You don't have to remember every variable. Simply use the **"Insert Variable"** dropdown in the editor to see all available placeholders for your selected automation type and insert them with a single click.

### Example Template
Here is an example of a great order confirmation message:

```
Hello {{customer_name}}! üëã

Thank you for your order! We've successfully received your payment for order #{{order_number}}.

Total Amount: {{total_amount}}

We'll notify you again once your items have shipped.
```

## Previewing Your Template
Use the **"Preview"** tab to see how your message will look with sample data. You can edit the sample data on the right-hand side to test different scenarios and ensure your message looks perfect every time.
